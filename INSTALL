AUTOMATIC INSTALLATION:
-----------------------
1. You need to have a running JAVA servlet container. The eLogBook
   has been developed using Apache Tomcat 4.x, 5.x but it might also be
   possible to run it on other servlet engines (please report this back
   to us to include this information for future releases).

2. To have the optimal performance you should also have a web server
   for serving the static content of the eLogBook. We developed the
   eLogBook on Apache's httpd server (1.3.x and 2.0.x).

3. Assuming you have already unpacked the tar file holding all
   eLogBook files, just change to the newly created directory (eLogBook
   called in the following).
4. Execute the script 'install.sh' giving the name of a first eLogBook 
   you want to have created (you can easily add more later on), e.g.
	./install.sh MY
5. The script will ask you about a number of paths, names etc (NOTE:
   you can quit the script at any point, since the final installation is
   only done at the very end).
6. After successfull running the script, you will have to restart
   Apache httpd and tomcat to get the newly created web applications into 
   operation.
7. After this you should now be able to reach the new eLogBook at:
	http://localhost/MYelog

If this installation fails, consult the README file and/or the widely
available documentation on the web (e.g. www.apache.org/httpd in case
of problems concerning Apache httpd) or you may contact us
(doocsweb@sun52a.desy.de).
